    "description": "This research explores the implementation of V2X communication in the CARLA simulation platform using a ROS module and an infrastructure server with MQTT. A collaborative planning system enables real-time route recalculations based on alerts from infrastructure and vehicles. Evaluations of A* and Dijkstra algorithms show that A* performs better on small maps, while Dijkstra is more efficient on larger ones. The results confirm the systemâ€™s effectiveness, providing a solid foundation for future advancements in autonomous driving and traffic management."
