The development of **U-NEED** took place within the European Commission's <a href="https://www.upperprojecteu.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**UPPER project**</a> while working at <a href="https://www.grupoetra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**ETRA I+D**</a>. It is a **historical geospatial data visualizer** that supports and enhances multimodal public transportation systems.

### Purpose and Overview

**U-NEED** focuses on two fundamental datasets:

1. **Origin-Destination Matrices**: Visualizes travel distribution between public transport stops and vehicle flows between urban zones. This reveals population movement patterns and helps planners **optimize existing lines** or **introduce new routes** tailored to citizens' needs.

    <ImageWithModal

      alt="The app shows a map with arcs representing travel flows between public transport stops"
      width={600}
      height={300}

      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Origin / Destination matrices as arcs</span>
</div>

2. **Multimodal Transport Services Distribution**: Maps the availability of multimodal transport services to identify **underserved areas** where **access to public transportation can be improved**.

This data-driven approach supports both **public transport optimization** and broader **urban planning** decisions, such as:

- Establishing **Low Emission Zones (LEZ)**
- Designing **specialized transport lines**, like school-focused routes

      alt="The app shows a map with different services. The mouse is over one of them that shows information about the Valencia's university"

      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Service information</span>
</div>

### Key Features and Functionalities

**U-NEED** presents historical geospatial data through interactive, actionable visualizations, including:

- **Travel Distribution Visualization**: Shows movement patterns between stops and urban zones to **identify high-demand corridors** and **optimize route planning**.

- **Public Transport Service Analysis**:
  - Maps the **distribution of multimodal services**, revealing areas with insufficient coverage.
  - Supports **urban infrastructure planning** by pinpointing gaps in accessibility.

    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Layers selection modal</span>
</div>

### Spatial Analysis Capabilities

The most powerful part of **U-NEED** is its **spatial analysis** tooling, which lets users combine datasets or modify them to create custom analyses. These tools were built for flexibility and scalability, although their full potential was not realized due to a professional shift.

Key spatial analyses included:

- **Accessibility Index**:

  - Provides a comprehensive view of service accessibility across urban areas.
  - For more details, see the **Accessibility Index** section in **U-TWIN**.

- **Dynamic Buffer Analysis**:

  - Adjusts buffer sizes around **public transport stops** dynamically, visualizing **stop concentration** across the city.

    <ImageWithModal
      src="/projects/uneed/buffer.webp"
      alt="The app shows a map with bus stops as buffered circles"
      width={600}
      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Dynamic Buffer Analysis</span>
</div>

- **No-Coverage Visualization**:
  - Calculates the **percentage of urban areas lacking public transport coverage** by excluding buffered transport zones from the city's total area.

<div className='flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8'>
    <ImageWithModal
      src="/projects/uneed/coverage.webp"
      alt="The app shows a map with some parts of it mark as coverage and some other as not"
      width={600}
      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">No-Coverage Visualization</span>
</div>

These analyses uncovered meaningful mobility patterns and supported **data-driven decision-making** in public transportation planning.

### Future Potential

Several ambitious ideas were planned but not implemented, including:

- **Graph-Based Analysis and Isochrones**:
  - Using graph theory and isochrone calculations to **evaluate public transport accessibility** from various **points of interest**.
  - These analyses were intended to explore **travel time distributions** and identify **potential connectivity improvements**.

These ideas will be explored in a **future personal project**, building on the foundation created by **U-NEED**.

### Technology Stack

**U-NEED** was developed using a technology stack similar to **U-TWIN**, with the main difference being the use of <a href="https://kepler.gl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Kepler.GL**</a> instead of **Deck.GL** for geospatial visualization.

- **Frontend**:

  - Built with <a href="https://react.dev/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**React**</a>, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience.
  - Styled with <a href="https://mui.com/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**MUI**</a> for consistent UI components.

- **Visualization**:

  - **Kepler.GL** powers the interactive geospatial views, offering flexible layer management and dynamic filtering.

- **Backend**:
  - Developed on <a href="https://www.meteor.com/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Meteor**</a> for real-time data synchronization.
  - Utilized <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**MongoDB**</a> for:
    - **Database management**
    - **ETL pipelines** to ingest and process historical geospatial data
    - **Data storage and historical analysis** for generating insights

### Impact and Legacy

While **U-NEED** laid the groundwork for **advanced geospatial analytics** and **multimodal transport planning**, its full potential remains untapped. The tool's conceptual framework and flexible architecture provide a strong foundation for **future innovation** in urban mobility and smart city planning.

With the possibility of integrating **graph-based analysis** and **isochrones**, **U-NEED** represents an ambitious step toward **intelligent transportation systems** and **data-driven urban planning**.

This journey, although paused due to a career transition, will continue in a **future personal project**, where the vision of a **comprehensive urban mobility analytics platform** can be fully realized.
