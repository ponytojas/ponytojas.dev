The development of **U-TWIN** took place within the European Commission's <a href="https://www.upperprojecteu.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**UPPER project**</a> while working at <a href="https://www.grupoetra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**ETRA I+D**</a>. The goal was to create a powerful tool for visualizing geospatial data related to public transportation and multimodal mobility.

</div>

### Key Features

U-TWIN provided a comprehensive view of transportation networks, allowing users to visualize:

- **Public transport lines and stops**
- **Real-time vehicle positions** for buses, trams, and other modes of transport
- **Shared bike station status**, including available bikes and docks
- **Traffic service levels** and live road alerts, such as accidents or closures

Over time, additional urban data layers were incorporated, such as:

- **City zoning and administrative boundaries**
- **Locations of key services**, including hospitals and schools
- **Road networks**
- **Early-stage geospatial analysis**, focusing on **accessibility indices**

    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Stop details</span>
</div>

### Functionalities

The platform also offered **search and geolocation features**, enabling users to quickly locate specific transport stops or points of interest. For example, searching for a **specific bus stop** automatically moved the map to that location.

Additional functionalities included:

- Viewing **all stops along a transport line**
- Identifying **routes passing through a given stop**
- Filtering and interacting with various datasets in real time

### Technology Stack

U-TWIN was developed using <a href="https://react.dev/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**React**</a>, running on <a href="https://www.meteor.com/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Meteor**</a>. The frontend used <a href="https://mui.com/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**MUI**</a> for UI components and <a href="https://deck.gl/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Deck.GL**</a> for geospatial visualization.

On the backend, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**MongoDB**</a> was chosen due to its seamless integration with Meteor.

- **Database management**
- **ETL pipelines** for data extraction, transformation, and loading from multiple sources
- **Historical data storage and processing** for analytical insights

### Accessibility Index

To enhance **U-TWIN**'s analytical and visualization capabilities - and as a preparatory step for a complementary tool developed within the project - I designed what we referred to as the **Accessibility Index**.

<div className='flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8'>
    <ImageWithModal
      src="/projects/utwin/hex.webp"
      alt="The app shows a map with hexagons of different colors on it"
      width={600}
      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Accessibility index hex</span>
</div>

While similar approaches exist in many GIS applications, our methodology was created from scratch through brainstorming and iteration. The goal was to assess the **distribution of essential services** across urban areas and provide a clear picture of how well key facilities were positioned relative to the population.

1. **City Boundaries & Hexagonal Grid**  
   We started by delineating the city's boundary. Since there was no universal approach that fit every city, we typically extracted district or neighborhood geometries from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**OpenStreetMap (OSM)**</a> and merged them into a single urban boundary. This area was then divided into **hexagonal cells** with a **125-meter radius**. _(At the time, I was unaware of <a href="http://uber.com/en-ES/blog/h3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Uber's H3**</a> hexagonal indexing system, which would have been an ideal alternative.)_

2. **Service Point Identification**  
   We identified key urban services - **hospitals, universities, schools, and industrial zones** - again leveraging **OSM** as a data source. Each service type was geocoded and mapped accordingly.

3. **Proximity & Travel Time Calculation**  
   For each **hexagon centroid**, we determined the **nearest service** of each category. Using <a href="https://project-osrm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM)**</a>, we calculated estimated travel time across three modes of transport:

   - **Walking**
   - **Cycling**
   - **Driving**

4. **Scoring System & Visualization**  
   To quantify accessibility, we built a **scoring model**:

   - If a service was **contained within** or **touched** the hexagon, it received **100 points**.
   - For every additional **two minutes of travel time**, **one point** was deducted.

   These thresholds were based on **average walking speed** and various **urban studies** that define perceived accessibility.

5. **Geospatial Representation**  
   Finally, accessibility scores were visualized on the **U-TWIN** map with a **color-coded gradient** to represent different levels of access. This provided a clear, intuitive overview of service distribution and helped planners identify gaps in infrastructure and mobility planning.
