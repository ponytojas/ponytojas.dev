**MyTasks** was born out of a personal need to better track and summarize weekly work activities. While my team primarily uses **Jira** to manage tasks and tickets, I often found myself involved in responsibilities that didn’t fall under a specific Jira issue — such as **reviewing pull requests**, **helping teammates**, or handling **production hotfixes** and **database interventions**.

Every Friday, my manager would ask for a quick summary of what I had done during the week and what I planned for the next. More often than not, I realized I couldn’t remember half the things I’d done. This inspired me to design and build a lightweight tool to solve this exact problem.

### Purpose and Overview

**MyTasks** is a simple and intuitive app that helps users **log daily tasks** and generate **automated summaries**.

<div className='flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8'>
    <ImageWithModal
      src="/projects/my-tasks/login.webp"
      alt="The image shows a basic login screen with black buttons and white background"
      width={600}
      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Login screen</span>
</div>

The interface is divided into two parts:

- A **calendar** on the left to select the week
- A **daily task list** on the right showing the days of the selected week

<div className='flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8'>
    <ImageWithModal
      src="/projects/my-tasks/main.webp"
      alt="The image shows a basic main screen with task lists and a calendar"
      width={600}
      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Main screen</span>
</div>

For each day, I can quickly **add tasks** with the following details:

- **Title**
- **Notes or description**
- **Status** (e.g., done, in progress, blocked)
- **Type** (work or personal)

<div className='flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8'>
 <ImageWithModal
      src="/projects/my-tasks/add.webp"
      alt="The image shows the form used to add a new task"
      width={600}
      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Add task form</span>
</div>

This structure helps me maintain a clear record of my daily efforts, even when they don’t appear in official tracking systems.

### AI-Powered Summarization

One of the most useful features is the **AI summary generation**. I added two buttons:

- **Daily summary**
- **Weekly summary**

Both use the **ChatGPT API** to generate natural-language summaries of the tasks recorded, saving me time when sending reports to my manager or simply reflecting on the week.

<div className='flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8'>
    <ImageWithModal
      src="/projects/my-tasks/summary.webp"
      alt="The image shows a summary example"
      width={600}
      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Summary example</span>
</div>

### Technology Stack

The application is intentionally minimalistic, focusing on usability and speed. It was built using:

- <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Next.js**</a> for the frontend and routing
- <a href="https://pocketbase.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**PocketBase**</a> as a lightweight backend and database
- <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Tailwind CSS**</a> and <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**shadcn/ui**</a> for styling and components

While simple in scope, **MyTasks** solved a recurring issue in my day-to-day work.

### From Personal to Team-Wide

Originally built just for myself, I eventually shared the app with my manager. He liked the idea — and now we’re working together to evolve **MyTasks** into a tool for **company-wide usage**. It's a perfect example of how solving a personal pain point can grow into something with broader value.
