**MyTasks** started as a way to better track and summarize weekly work.
While my team uses **Jira** for tasks and tickets, a lot of my work happens outside of it - things like **reviewing pull requests**, **helping teammates**, or handling **production hotfixes** and **database interventions**.

Every Friday my manager asked for a quick summary of the week and my plan for the next. I often realized I could not remember half of what I had done. That is what pushed me to build a lightweight tool to capture those tasks as they happen.

### Purpose and Overview

**MyTasks** is a simple, focused app for **logging daily tasks** and generating **automated summaries**.

<div className='flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8'>
    <ImageWithModal
      src="/projects/my-tasks/login.webp"
      alt="The image shows a basic login screen with black buttons and white background"
      width={600}
      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Login screen</span>
</div>

The interface is split into two parts:

- A **calendar** on the left to select the week
- A **daily task list** on the right showing the days of the selected week

<div className='flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8'>
    <ImageWithModal
      src="/projects/my-tasks/main.webp"
      alt="The image shows a basic main screen with task lists and a calendar"
      width={600}
      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Main screen</span>
</div>

For each day, I can quickly **add tasks** with the following details:

- **Title**
- **Notes or description**
- **Status** (e.g., done, in progress, blocked)
- **Type** (work or personal)

<div className='flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8'>
 <ImageWithModal
      src="/projects/my-tasks/add.webp"
      alt="The image shows the form used to add a new task"
      width={600}
      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Add task form</span>
</div>

This structure keeps a clear record of daily work, even when it does not show up in official tracking systems.

### AI-Powered Summarization

One of the most useful features is **AI summary generation**. I added two buttons:

- **Daily summary**
- **Weekly summary**

Both call the **ChatGPT API** to generate natural-language summaries of the tasks recorded, which saves time when sending reports or reflecting on the week.

<div className='flex flex-col justify-center items-center my-8'>
    <ImageWithModal
      src="/projects/my-tasks/summary.webp"
      alt="The image shows a summary example"
      width={600}
      height={300}
      modalClassName="rounded-xl"
      priority
    />
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Summary example</span>
</div>

### Technology Stack

The app is intentionally minimalistic and optimized for speed. It was built with:

- <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Next.js**</a> for the frontend and routing
- <a href="https://pocketbase.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**PocketBase**</a> as a lightweight backend and database
- <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Tailwind CSS**</a> and <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**shadcn/ui**</a> for styling and components

While simple in scope, **MyTasks** solved a recurring issue in my day-to-day work.

### From Personal to Team-Wide

I originally built the app for myself, then shared it with my manager. He liked the idea, and now we are working together to evolve **MyTasks** into a tool for **company-wide usage**. It is a clear example of how a personal pain point can turn into broader value.

### Test it out
You can try out the app yourself <LinkArrow url="https://tasks.ponytojas.dev/" inline={true} text="here"/>. There's a demo account to let you explore the features without needing to create an account.
