I'm **Dani**. I build software systems that survive in the real world.

I treat architecture like a living ecosystem. It’s not just about boxes and arrows; it’s about how components breathe, communicate, and—inevitably—fail without taking the whole ship down with them. I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** based in Spain, currently obsessed with **distributed systems** and **geospatial data**.

Most of my work involves **leading technical strategy** and architecting systems that can scale. I focus on reducing complexity, ensuring reliability, and mentoring teams to deliver high-quality software. I don't see the point in a sub-millisecond API if the entire system is brittle. I’ve spent the last few years engineering everything from **digital twins** for European public transport to mission-critical **internal tooling** for automotive engineering.

I’m pragmatic about my stack. I use **TypeScript**, **Go**, and **React** for most things, but I’ll grab **Python** for data pipelines, **C++** for raw performance, or **Flutter** if I need to go mobile. I care about picking the right tool for the job, not the one that’s currently trending on Twitter.

When I'm not staring at traces or debugging race conditions, I'm probably building small tools for myself, visualizing weird datasets I found online, or just trying to make a computer do something cool.

And yes, I still answer to a <RotatingTooltipText
