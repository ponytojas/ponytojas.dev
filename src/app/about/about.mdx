I'm **Dani** — a Spanish **software engineer** who treats **software architecture** like a carefully balanced ecosystem (or a very picky houseplant: ignore it for a week and it all falls apart). I get genuinely excited about designing **systems** where each component knows its job, communicates flawlessly, and doesn't randomly throw errors at 3 a.m.

I'm particularly obsessed with **geospatial data** and how it shapes real-world challenges like **transportation**, **urban mobility**, and **traffic management**. To me, a **city** is like a **distributed system** with way too many edge cases — buses, bikes, pedestrians, and any kind of vehicles. I've also worked with cutting-edge technologies such as trying to teach cars to communicate with each other  (**V2X**) and with **transportation planning tools**.

My tech stack is a bit like my toolbox: [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Golang](https://go.dev/), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [C++](https://isocpp.org/), [Java](https://www.java.com/), [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)… basically, if it can ship code, build an interface, or store data without crashing, I've probably played with it. 

I think about **infrastructure** and **user experience** as two sides of the same coin, because what's the point of a blazing-fast backend if your UI feels like a 90's dial-up?

When I'm not coding for work, I'm probably coding for fun, building **small tools** that scratch an itch, **visualizing messy data** until it tells a story, or just experimenting with some new **framework** that I'll either love or regret in a week.

Oh, and I live with a <RotatingTooltipText
