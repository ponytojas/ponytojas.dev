I'm **Dani**. I build software that holds up in the real world.

I see architecture as a living system. It is less about boxes and arrows and more about how components communicate and fail without taking everything down. I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** based in Spain, currently focused on **distributed systems** and **geospatial data**.

Most of my work centers on technical strategy and designing systems that scale. I try to reduce complexity, improve reliability, and help teams ship with confidence. I don't chase sub-millisecond APIs if the system is brittle. Over the last few years I've built everything from **digital twins** for European public transport to mission-critical **internal tooling** for automotive engineering.

I'm pragmatic about tools. **TypeScript**, **Go**, and **React** are my defaults, but I'll reach for **Python** for data pipelines, **C++** for raw performance, or **Flutter** for mobile. I pick what fits the problem, not what is trending on Twitter.

When I'm not staring at traces or debugging race conditions, I'm usually building small tools, exploring odd datasets, or just trying to make a computer do something neat.

And yes, I still answer to a <RotatingTooltipText
