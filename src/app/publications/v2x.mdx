This research explores the implementation of **V2X** communication in the **CARLA simulation platform** using a ROS module and an infrastructure server with **MQTT**. A collaborative planning system enables real-time route recalculations based on alerts from infrastructure and vehicles. Evaluations of *A** and *Dijkstra* algorithms show that *A** performs better on small maps, while *Dijkstra* is more efficient on larger ones. The results confirm the system's effectiveness, <u>providing a solid foundation for future advancements in autonomous driving and traffic management</u>.
