At this fast-paced LegalTech startup, I helped modernize the legacy codebase and scale the product to meet enterprise demands.

*   **Monorepo Migration:** Led the migration of the core platform from Vue 2 to a **Nuxt 3 monorepo**, cutting build times by **40%** and improving developer velocity by unifying shared component libraries.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Identified and resolved critical bottlenecks in the document rendering engine, improving load times for complex legal contracts.
*   **Feature Ownership:** Owned the end-to-end development of "Smart Forms," enabling legal teams to automate data collection through dynamic, logic-driven questionnaires.
