At this fast-paced LegalTech startup, I played a pivotal role in modernizing the legacy codebase and scaling the product to meet enterprise demands.

*   **Monorepo Migration:** Spearheaded the architectural migration of the core platform from Vue 2 to a **Nuxt 3 monorepo**. This strategic refactor reduced build times by **40%** and significantly improved developer velocity by unifying shared component libraries.
*   **Performance Optimization:** identified and resolved critical bottlenecks in the document rendering engine, improving the load time of complex legal contracts for end-users.
*   **Feature Ownership:** Led the end-to-end development of the "Smart Forms" feature, a key value driver that allowed legal teams to automate data collection through dynamic, logic-driven questionnaires.
