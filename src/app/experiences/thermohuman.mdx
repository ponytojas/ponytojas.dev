I engineered features for a pioneering **HealthTech** platform used by elite sports teams (La Liga, NBA) to prevent injuries via thermal imaging analysis.

*   **Performance Analytics:** Optimized the data processing pipeline that converts thermal images into actionable physiological metrics, assisting medical staff in real-time decision making.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Instilled a culture of reliability by implementing automated testing suites (**PHPUnit**, **Jest**, **Puppeteer**) and establishing strict code review protocols.
*   **Platform Evolution:** Led the modernization of the legacy **LAMP** stack frontend towards a responsive **React**-based interface, significantly improving usability for non-technical medical personnel.
