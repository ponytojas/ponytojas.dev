I worked on developing and maintaining a performance-tracking platform for elite athletes, including professional football players and Olympic competitors. The software used thermal imaging analysis to support injury recovery, monitor physical condition, and optimize training. I built full-stack applications in a LAMP environment, using React for the frontend and Python and Bash to automate key workflows. I also focused on improving the user experience and ensuring code quality through testing frameworks like PHPUnit, Jest, and Puppeteer, while actively contributing to team code reviews.
