I built features for a pioneering **HealthTech** platform used by elite sports teams (La Liga, NBA) to prevent injuries through thermal imaging analysis.

*   **Performance Analytics:** Optimized the pipeline that converts thermal images into actionable physiological metrics, helping medical staff make decisions in real time.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Instituted automated testing suites (**PHPUnit**, **Jest**, **Puppeteer**) and stricter code review practices to improve reliability.
*   **Platform Evolution:** Led the modernization of the legacy **LAMP** frontend into a responsive **React** interface, improving usability for non-technical medical staff.
