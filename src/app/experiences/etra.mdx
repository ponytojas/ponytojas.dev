I was a **Technical Lead** on major European research initiatives focused on **Smart Cities** and **Urban Mobility**, connecting hardware sensors to high-level decision dashboards.

*   **UPPER Project (EU):** Architected a **digital twin** platform for public transport, integrating real-time telemetry from heterogeneous sources and rendering high-performance geospatial views with **Deck.GL** and **Kepler.GL**.
*   **UNCHAIN Project:** Defined and implemented a sustainable logistics platform that uses a **DataSpace** (from IDSA) to securely share sensitive data between stakeholders, connected with multiple tools like a decision maker for logistic curbside allocation on cities.
*   **Kubernetes & DevOps:** Managed containerized deployments, optimizing resource usage and ensuring high availability for pilot demonstrations across multiple European cities.
