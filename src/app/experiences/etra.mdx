I served as a **Technical Lead** for major European research initiatives focused on **Smart Cities** and **Urban Mobility**, bridging the gap between hardware sensors and high-level decision-making dashboards.

*   **UPPER Project (EU):** Architected a **digital twin** platform for public transport, integrating real-time telemetry from heterogeneous sources. Leveraged **Deck.GL** and **Kepler.GL** to render high-performance geospatial visualizations of transit networks.
*   **UNCHAIN Project:** Led the technical definition and implementation of a sustainable logistics platform. Designed an event-driven microservices architecture using **Go** and **NATS**, ensuring decoupled communication between IoT edge devices (ESP32/LoRa) and the cloud.
*   **Kubernetes & DevOps:** Managed the containerized deployment of services, optimizing resource usage and ensuring high availability for pilot demonstrations across multiple European cities.
