I contributed to the <a href="https://www.upperprojecteu.eu/" target='_blank'>UPPER</a> **European project** by developing a web application for managing and visualizing public transport systems, integrating digital twin technology and advanced data analysis tools. I also took on a <b>technical leadership</b> role in the UNCHAIN project, focused on improving last-mile logistics services. These initiatives were part of **cutting-edge research** and innovation efforts to enhance **urban mobility** across Europe.
