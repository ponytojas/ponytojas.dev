I worked at the intersection of data science and software engineering, building the systems behind automated sports journalism.

*   **NLG Pipelines:** Built **Natural Language Generation** models that turned structured football match data into human-readable news articles in real time.
*   **Data Automation:** Developed **ETL pipelines** in **Python** to ingest, clean, and normalize high-frequency data streams from official leagues (La Liga, Premier League).
*   **Model Optimization:** Worked with linguists and data scientists to fine-tune model output for grammatical accuracy and narrative variety.
