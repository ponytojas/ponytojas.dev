I operated at the intersection of Data Science and Software Engineering, building the engines behind automated sports journalism.

*   **NLG Pipelines:** Engineered **Natural Language Generation** models capable of synthesizing structured football match data into human-readable news articles in real-time.
*   **Data Automation:** Built robust **ETL pipelines** using **Python** to ingest, clean, and normalize high-frequency data streams from official leagues (La Liga, Premier League).
*   **Model Optimization:** Collaborated with linguists and data scientists to fine-tune model output, ensuring grammatical accuracy and narrative variety in generated content.
