I designed and built custom web platforms using PHP, Node.js, and modern JavaScript frameworks. I developed IoT solutions with SSR-based Nuxt applications and PostgreSQL, and created hybrid mobile apps using React Native. I also automated key workflows with Bash and Python, contributed to CMS development (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla), and mentored interns. Beyond development, I was involved in technical decision-making, gathering client requirements, and preparing proposals for new projects.
