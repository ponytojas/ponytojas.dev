As a **Lead Fullstack Engineer** contracted for **BMW**, I architect and build mission-critical internal tooling that accelerates vehicle prototyping and testing. I own the entire lifecycle—from requirements gathering with automotive engineers to system design, implementation, and deployment within a highly restricted **private cloud environment**.

Key contributions include:
*   **Firmware Delivery System:** Engineered a secure web-based platform enabling engineers to flash test firmware onto prototype vehicle ECUs, reducing manual intervention and testing cycles.
*   **Vehicle Topology Visualization:** Developed complex visualizations for internal electronic car architectures, allowing engineers to inspect and debug on-board networks intuitively.
*   **Infrastructure & Scalability:** Designed the backend services to be stateless and scalable, utilizing **Redis** and **BullMQ** for handling asynchronous job queues related to heavy data processing.
