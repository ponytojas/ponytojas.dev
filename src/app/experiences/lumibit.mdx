As a **Senior Full-Stack Engineer** at **Lumibit Digital** (contracted for **BMW**), I build internal products used by thousands of engineers across multiple applications. Most of the work runs inside a highly restricted **private cloud**, so shipping means being pragmatic: deliver value fast, but never at the expense of reliability or security constraints.

I usually own features end-to-end — from clarifying requirements with domain experts, to architecture, implementation, and production support.

Key contributions:
* **Functionality track system:** A **feature lifecycle management tool** that tracks required functionalities across vehicle models, monitoring component status, ownership, and real-time metrics to ensure delivery and compliance.
* **Vehicle topology visualization:** Turned internal vehicle architecture definitions (compiled from multiple internal data sources) into an interactive **SVG-based** explorer — clickable elements, targeted search, and contextual details — making complex systems easier to navigate and debug.
* **Scalable data processing & automation:** Designed stateless backend services and background pipelines with **Redis** + **BullMQ** to parse large datasets, run validations, and handle long-running preprocessing. This improved overall app responsiveness and enabled new features like event-driven notifications (e.g., emails for key events or expirations).
* **Test vehicle utilization & availability system:** A fleet availability and utilization platform that visualizes test vehicle allocation across teams on a timeline, tracking assignments, availability, and in/out metrics while aggregating data from multiple vehicle data sources.
