I'm currently developing software tools for <b>BMW</b> engineers. My role is <b>fullstack</b>, covering everything from gathering requirements based on engineers' needs to designing the application, coding it end-to-end, and deploying it to their private cloud. These tools range from software that enables flashing test firmware onto prototype vehicles to applications for visualizing the internal electronic maps of the cars.
